Snowflake: dragging fractals
------

Most ideas are from [Recusive Drawing][draw]. I only draw curve here.

### Edit

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jiyinyiyong/snowflake.git
cd snowflake
bower install
node-dev calabash # if you have these two commands installed
```

Visit the HTML pages with Chrome to see how it works:
